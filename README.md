# Infinite-Client

## What Happened?
Infinite Client got leaked by an ex-dev known as "kv", the client now got a hard reset however the leak might be unsafe so I got the safe Beta v0.2 since I used to be the beta tester.
*Disclaimer: Fizzify was the owner of the old Infinite Client, this is why it looks like an Eric Golde skid since Fizzify has a reputation from skidding from him. Also this is the Beta v0.2 of Infinite and since it hard reset, Fizzify did not have an owner role on the Discord.*
*Another Disclaimer: Merpy gave me permission to upload the Beta*

# Download Instructions

1. Check the releases page (it's to the right)
2. Download the .zip (and convert it to a .rar if necessary)
3. Go to %appdata% then go to your .minecraft folder
4. Extract the file to your Versions folder
5. Go to the Minecraft Launcher and make a new installation
6. Try and locate "release Infinite"
7. You should now be able to try a very buggy Eric Golde skid
